    #   mouse: follow mouse pointer
    #   keyboard: follow window with keyboard focus
    #   none: don't follow anything
    #
    # "keyboard" needs a window manager that exports the
    # _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW property.
    # This should be the case for almost all modern window managers.
    #
    # If this option is set to mouse or keyboard, the monitor option
    # will be ignored.

    # number to specify a constant width or two numbers for the minimum and

    # neccesary.
    # Examples: width = 300 # constant width of 300 width = (0, 300) # width
    # between 0 and 300
    # When setting a width bigger than the screen, dunst will clamp the width
    # to the screen width. So if you want the notifcation to stretch the
    # entire screen dynamically, you may set the width to a high enough number,
    # which none of your screens exceed (e.g. 10000).

    # offset format: (horizontal, vertical)
    # Respectively the horizontal and vertical offset in pixels from the
    # corner of the screen specified by origin. A negative offset will lead to
    # the notification being off screen.
